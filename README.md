# dialog_simulator
Short python code which simulates a dialog according to a script by using a text to speech library . You can give yourself a role from the script and read your part yourself.

This code uses the ```pyttsx3``` library in oreder to read aloud. You might need to install it in oreder to be able to run the script. Link: https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
 
The code loads the dialog script out of a file (```dialog.txt``` by default). You might need to paste or change the path of the file. You can change the filepath (```open(file arg)```) in line (~)9.

Than it gets the name of the character you want to be and activates a ```for line in dialog:``` following this algorythm:

1. if
2. h
